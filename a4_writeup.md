# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
the most difficult part was figuring how to more efficently implememnt all win conditions without just writing an if statement for all 8 conditions. Also getting used to using classes in Python since this was the first time I've ever used them in Python.s

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player first by expirimenting with randomized moves, then giving it a way to figure out which move would be the best in any given situation
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I could implement preset winning or drawing final boards that the computer wants to accomplish given it goes first or second, considering that there really are only a few winning moves/stratagies that consistently work, so it would work like a branching path of decisions.
